(1) Using the Customer Table, select the CustomerName, ContactName, and Country.  Use ORDER BY to order by Country.  
Use LIMIT and OFFSET to get entries 11 through 20. Paste your SQL statement below. 

    SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Country 
    FROM Customers
    ORDER BY Country
    LIMIT 20
    OFFSET 10;

(2) Select all columns from the Customer table where the ContactName starts with A.  Paste your SQL statement below.

    SELECT * FROM Customers 
    WHERE ContactName 
    LIKE 'A%';

(3) Select all columns from the OrderDetails table where the ProductID is 51 and the quantity is greater than 10.
Paste your SQL statement below.

    SELECT * FROM OrderDetails 
    WHERE ProductID = 51 AND Quantity > 10;

(4) Insert 3 rows into the Products table.  Note that you will have to specify a valid SupplierID and CategoryID, 
corresponding to rows from the Supplier and Category tables.  Paste your three SQL statements below.


    INSERT INTO Products (ProductName, SupplierID, CategoryID, Unit, Price)
        VALUES ("Soup of the Day", 6, 7, "50 - 12 oz cartons", 30),
        ("Chicken Parm", 7, 6, "14 cuts of meat", 26),
        ("Pasta", 5, 4, "10 pounds", 15);

(5) Update the two top rows of the Products Table to increase the price by 1.50. (Get SQL to do the addition for you.)  Paste your SQL statement below.

    UPDATE Products
    SET Price = (Price + 1.50)
    WHERE ProductID = 1 OR ProductID = 2;

(6) Delete all rows of the Products Table where the price is less than 7.00. Paste your SQL statement below.

    DELETE FROM Products
    WHERE Price < 7;
